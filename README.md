### Simply prepend `vx` to `threads.net` (e.g. `vxthreads.net`) to get an embed of a Threads post!

`vxthreads` is a user-friendly utility tool that enables seamless embedding of threads.net links just by simply prepending the URL with `vx`, like `vxthreads.net`. Inspired by the works of other similar projects like `FixTweet` and `InstaFix`, `vxthreads` aims to provide a more accessible and efficient way of sharing and embedding threads from threads.net.

## Features

- **Easy Embeds**: Just prepend your threads.net link with `vx` and your embed is ready to use!
- **Lightweight**: The tool is designed with performance in mind.
